## IoT project
Hi Everyone!
The relevant files for the submission are under "Submission" folder. In this folder there are 2 folders and a python file:
1. ESP32-CAM code folder:"Serial_comm_ESP_Code".
1. Arduino code folder: "Serial_comm_Arduino_Code".
1. Inventory-Check python file: "inventoryCheck.py".

In order to run the project, you must upload the code from both folders. The python file implements the inventory check for the coffee-stand's managers, and is optional.
